# Unity-VRPointerVive

This repository is based on the following:  
https://github.com/wacki/Unity-VRInputModule

The goal is a laser pointer for a VR experience with HTC Vive using Unity and SteamVR 2.0.  
To achieve this, some scripts had to be modified.  
Also, this repository will only focus on the HTC Vive with SteamVR.
